Python + Streamlit version of degree loan calculator

Currently the estimator does not account for things such as lay offs, time between jobs, raises/promotions, salary increases.
Does account for;
tuition increase between years
interest on loan
various term lengths
cost of living
expected salary upon graduation


Ideally would add button to type in chosen profession and provide rough estimate of entry level salary vs currently user provided.
