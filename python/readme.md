## Python + Streamlit version of degree loan calculator

[See it in action here](https://degree-loan-feasibility.streamlit.app/)

Currently the estimator does not account for things such as lay offs, time between jobs, raises/promotions, salary increases.
<br>
Does account for;
tuition increase between years,
interest on loan,
various term lengths,
cost of living,
expected salary upon graduation
<br>

Ideally would add button to type in chosen profession and provide rough estimate of entry level salary vs currently user provided.
